**🚀 My Projects**

I love bringing ideas to life through code! One of my notable projects is:

**Gomoku**

A personalized twist on classic Tic-Tac-Toe, played on a 5x5 grid. Players use the first characters of their first names instead of X's and O's, making each match a unique "signature duel." The goal is to align at least four letters in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to win. This game blends the simplicity of Tic-Tac-Toe with the strategic depth of Gomoku, adding identity and flair to every move 🎮.

In the website is a link to the game. You really should try it out!
